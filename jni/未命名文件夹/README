dct.c: This provides access via an array to the DCT coefficients which can then be modified before being re-saved as another JPEG. It depends on the IJG JPEG library (or libjpeg) which can be found here: http://www.ijg.org/

f5algorithm.c:  Shows a dummy example of how to implement the f5 algorithm
